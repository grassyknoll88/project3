# PupLife

A social media network for you and your pup!
 

## MERN App

This full-stack app allows users to communicate and share details of their dog.  Upon signup, the user's information is captured in the MySQL database.  GET, POST and UPDATE routes retrieve and add new data to the databases. 

Authentication allows users to access their personal profiles which displays reviews posted from previous play dates. 

### Installing
To get started: git clone git@github.com:KileyAdams92/project3.git 
The app uses several npm packages. To install these packages, navigate to the project folder and type:

yarn install

Make a .gitignore file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.


### coding style tests
The front/client utalizes ES6
The backend primarly utalizes ES5
